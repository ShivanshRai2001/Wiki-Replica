                A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, cycle, or (if three-wheeled) trike, is a two- or three-wheeled motor 
                vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, 
                commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being 
                involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
                </br></br>
                The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal 
                combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production 
                motorcycle.[4][5]
                </br></br>
                In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), 
                and Hero MotoCorp (India).[6] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices 
                and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern 
                Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.
                </br></br>
                According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times 
                higher for motorcycles than for cars.[7]

                The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see § Legal definitions and restrictions).
                </br></br>
                There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there are many 
                sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type, such as road 
                racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.
                </br></br>
                Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road motorcycles 
                include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in 
                most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to 
                make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.
                </br></br>
                Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different 
                riding posture.
                </br></br>
                In some countries the use of pillions (rear seats) is restricted.

            <p>
                The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. 
                It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach 
                in Bad Cannstatt, Germany, in 1885.[8] This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles 
                or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle 
                and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics 
                developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.[9]
            </br></br>
                The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient 
                testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.[10][11]
            </br></br>
                The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol 
                Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884.[12] He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the 
                Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884. The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in 
                Greenwich, in 1888.[13]
            </br></br>
                The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8 hp (0.47 kW), 
                40 cc (2.4 cu in) displacement, 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke, flat twin four-stroke engine 
                (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor 
                (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting 
                was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was 
                controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising 
                and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two 
                small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed 
                to find sufficient financial backing.[14]
            </br></br>
                Many authorities have excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the 
                definition of a 'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world's first motorcycle.[15][16][17] 
                Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide,[18] defining only internal-combustion powered 
                two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic. The first (petroleum fueled) internal-combustion 
                motorcycles, like the German Reitwagen, were, however, also the first practical motorcycles.[16][19][20]
            </br></br>
                If a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built 
                seem to be the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filled in December 
                1868,[10][11] constructed around the same time as the American Roper steam velocipede, built by Sylvester H. 
                Roper Roxbury, Massachusetts.[10][11] who demonstrated his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. 
                in 1867,[8] Roper built about 10 steam cars and cycles from the 1860s until his death in 1896.[17]

                    In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be 
                    called a motorcycle (German: Motorrad).[10][11][17][21] Excelsior Motor Company, originally a bicycle 
                    manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896.
                    </br></br>
                    The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by Charles Metz in 1898 at his factory 
                    in Waltham, Massachusetts
                    </br></br>
                    In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the 
                    new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the 
                    number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles 
                    often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.
                    </br></br>
                    At the end of the 19th century the first major mass-production firms were set up. In 1898, Triumph Motorcycles in 
                    England began producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes. Other British firms were Royal 
                    Enfield, Norton, Douglas Motorcycles and Birmingham Small Arms Company who began motorbike production in 1899, 1902, 
                    1907 and 1910, respectively.[22] Indian began production in 1901 and Harley-Davidson was established two years later. 
                    By the outbreak of World War I, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian,[23][24] producing over 
                    20,000 bikes per year.[25]

                    During the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective 
                    communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles 
                    carrying messages, performing reconnaissance and acting as a military police. American company Harley-Davidson was 
                    devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company Triumph 
                    Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. With the rear wheel 
                    driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc (30.5 cu in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. 
                    It was also the first Triumph without pedals.[26][better source needed]
                    </br></br>
                    The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".[27] Introduced in 1915 
                    it had a 550 cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular 
                    with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph".[28]

                    By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest manufacturer,[29] with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.[30][31]
                    </br></br>
                    Amongst many British motorcycle manufacturers, Chater-Lea with its twin-cylinder models followed by its large singles in the 1920s 
                    stood out. Initially, using converted a Woodmann-designed ohv Blackburne engine it became the first 350 cc to exceed 100 mph (160 km/h), 
                    recording 100.81 mph (162.24 km/h) over the flying kilometre during April 1924.[7] Later, Chater-Lea set a world record for the flying 
                    kilometre for 350 cc and 500 cc motorcycles at 102.9 mph (165.6 km/h) for the firm. Chater-Lea produced variants of these world-beating 
                    sports models and became popular among racers at the Isle of Man TT. Today, the firm is probably best remembered for its long-term 
                    contract to manufacture and supply AA Patrol motorcycles and sidecars.[citation needed]
                    </br></br>
                    By the late 1920s or early 1930s, DKW in Germany took over as the largest manufacturer.[32][33][34]

                    In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and the "dustbin fairing" held out the 
                    possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design. NSU and Moto Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development, both producing very radical 
                    designs well ahead of their time.[35] NSU produced the most advanced design, but after the deaths of four NSU riders in the 1954–1956 
                    seasons, they abandoned further development and quit Grand Prix motorcycle racing.[36]
                    </br></br>
                    Moto Guzzi produced competitive race machines, and until the end of 1957 had a succession of victories.[37] The following year, 1958, 
                    full enclosure fairings were banned from racing by the FIM in the light of the safety concerns.
                    </br></br>
                    From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of East German MZs Walter Kaaden's engine work in the 1950s.[38]

                    In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by Indian and Japanese motorcycle companies. In addition to the large capacity motorcycles, 
                    there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc) motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and 
                    India.[citation needed] 
                    </br></br>
                    A Japanese example is the 1958 Honda Super Cub, which went on to become the biggest selling vehicle of all time, with its 60 millionth 
                    unit produced in April 2008.[39] 
                    </br></br>
                    Today, this area is dominated by mostly Indian companies with Hero MotoCorp emerging as the world's largest manufacturer of 
                    two wheelers. Its Splendor model has sold more than 8.5 million to date.[40] Other major producers are Bajaj and TVS Motors.[41]
